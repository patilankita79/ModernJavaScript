<hr>

There are 3 possible keywords to define a variable
1. var
2. let
3. cont (introduced in ES6)

<strong>Important points [Variables]:</strong><br>
1. Variables can include letters, numbers, _, $
2. Variables cannot start with number
3. Variales starting with $ are ususally used in jQuery or DOM manipulation
4. Variables starting with _ are ususally private variables
5. In case of multiword variables, use camel case(e.g. var firstName), in case of object oriented programming, use pascal case(e.g. var FirstName)
6. let keyword works very similar to var
7. variables defined with const cannot be reassigned. They can be mutated but cannot be reassigned (in case of reference datatypes -> array, objects)
